# Error Boundaries

## Lab

<small>

**1. Next error boundaries**

- Try to run the application without starting the API server : it's broken
- Add a global error boundary to display a user-friendly maintenance page
- Take a look at the home page files : it has parralel routing !
- Implement error boundaries to the homepage for errors close to the problem

**2. Now you can re-start the API Server :**

`npm run start -w api`

**3. Custom error boundary**

- Take a look at the expenses details page : the page is broken ! :o
- Find the error cause
- Implement a custom Error boundary using `react-error-boundary` to prevent the whole page to break
