## Lab

<small>

**1. Streaming an entire page**

- The expense list page is long to load
- Implement streaming to this page to optimise loading

**2. Streaming and parallel routing**

- Add a loading state for homepage components

**3. Streaming only a part of a page**

- In the `ExpenseDetails` component, the `ExpenseEmployee` component is blocking : it must be loaded for the page to be rendered
- Add a loading state only to this part of the page
