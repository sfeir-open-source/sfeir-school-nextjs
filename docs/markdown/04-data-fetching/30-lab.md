## Lab

<small>

**1. On the server :**

- Create utility functions to GET data from the API
- Unmock the employees list page and use the API function
- Unmock the employee single page and use the API function

**2. On the client :**

- On the employee details page, there is a `<EmployeeExpenses />` component. It's displaying employee expenses on click, by making an asynchronous fetch request. Open it and find why it's not working
- Create a route handler to make this component work
