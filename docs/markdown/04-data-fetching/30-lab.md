# Data fetching

## Lab

1. On the server :
   - Create utility functions to GET data from the API
   - Unmock the employees list page and use the API function
   - Unmock the employee single page and use the API function
2. On the client :
   - On the employee details page, there is a `<EmployeeExpenses />` component. It's displaying employee expenses on click, by making an asynchronous fetch request. Open it and find why it's not working
   - Create a route handler to make this component work
