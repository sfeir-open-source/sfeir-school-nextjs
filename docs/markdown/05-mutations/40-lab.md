# Form hooks

## Lab

<small>

**1. Take a look at the `<Button />` component : it has a `loading` prop**

- Create a `SubmitFormButton` component
- Use the appropriate hook to get the loading status
- Display a loading state if the action is pending

**2. Take a look at the API response when you submit invalid data** (missing field or format error)

- In the `EmployeeForm`, use the appropriate hook to get the form state
- Pass the form validation errors to `TextFields` components
