# 02.01 - Pages and Layouts

## Running the lab

```
npm run start -w 02.01
```

## Instructions

**1. Create the application pages**

- Homepage
- Login page
- Employees pages (List, Detail, Edit, Create)
- Expenses page (List, Single)

**2. Add some metadatas (title, description)**

**3. Create the application layouts**

- Authentication layout for the login page
- Dashboard layout for all the rest

## Information

Styling isn't important, don't waste time on finding the right Tailwind classes

If you have enough time, you can use mocked data from `/src/data`<br/>
And you can help yourself to these components (from `/src/components`):

- DashboardLayout
- AuthLayout
- PageTitle
- PersonCard
- ExpensesTable
- ExpenseDetails
